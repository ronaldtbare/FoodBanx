# FoodBanx project1

I was one of four contributors to this project. My part was to implement Firebase so that the menu for the week can be saved and re-used. 

Target Audience: 
- Meal preppers
- Young professionals
- Busy people
- Working mothers/parents
- Money savers/budget conscious shoppers

Problems addressed:
- Time mangement
- Health/meal management
- Meal prep in general
- Learning to cook
- Digital organization

Primary goal:
- Take the stress and hassle out of meal planning and allow users to save time, money, and headaches

User Stories:
- As a "MEAL PREPPER", I want to "SAVE TIME IN MY PREPPING" so that I "SPEND THAT TIME DOING SOMETHING ELSE"
- As a "FUTURE MEAL PREPPER", I DONT want to "SPEND MONEY ON EXPENSIVE ORDERING SERVICES" so that I can "HAVE MORE MONEY"
- As a "BUSY MOTHER", I want to "HAVE A GROCERY TOOL" so that I can "COMBINE LISTS AND SAVE TIME"
